    "3. Dynamic Size: Add, remove, and other modification operations can be performed on lists. Lists can dynamically change in size.\n",
    "3. Allows Duplicates: List can have duplicate elements with different element index for each of the element.\n",
    "4. Contains Heterogenous Data Types: A variety of data types can be added to a single list.\n",
    "5. Slicing and Indexing: Elements can be accessed individually using indexing and sub-sets can be obtained using slicing.\n",
    "6. Built-in Methods: There are various built-in methods present for lists.i.e.,apped(),extend(),pop(),sort(),etc.\n",
    "7. Iterative: Lists can be iterated using loops.\n",
