    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages because of its ease of learning, simplicity, versatility and active community.\n",
    "Some of its key features are:\n",
    "1. Ease of learning: The syntax used in python are clear and written in form of natural language that makes it easy to read for others.\n",
    "2. Readability: The clean coding format allows developers to easily understand and minimize upfront errors.\n",
    "3. Versatility: Python can run on several operating systems and its procedural and object-oriented approach allows it to be used vastly.\n",
    "4. Huge Library: It has a variety of libraries available with multiple modules and packages that can handle web development, artificial intelligence as well as Machine Learning.\n",
    "5. Large Active Community: The active community present for python contributes to its maintenance of libraries and development driven by the community itself."
