        "<br>\n",
        "<ol>\n",
        "<li>Efficient array handling: NumPy introduces the ndarray object, which is a fast, flexible container for large data sets in Python. This allows users to work with large arrays and matrices efficiently.</li>\n",
        "<li>Numerical Computations: It provides a range of functions for performing mathematical operations on arrays, making it easier to implement complex numerical computations.</li>\n",
        "<li>Interoperability: NumPy arrays are designed to integrate seamlessly with other scientific computing libraries, such as SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, enabling a more robust analytical framework.</li>\n",
        "<li>Memory Efficiency: NumPy arrays require less memory than traditional Python lists. This is particularly beneficial when working with large datasets, as it allows for better memory management and performance.</li>\n",
        "<li>Convenience: NumPy provides a wide array of functions for mathematical operations, statistical analysis, and linear algebra, simplifying the coding process. It also supports broadcasting, which allows for operations between arrays of different shapes.</li><br>\n",
        "Enhancements to Python's Capabilities:\n",
        "<ol>\n",
        "<li>N-dimensional Arrays: Unlike Python lists, which are one-dimensional, NumPy allows the creation of multi-dimensional arrays, enabling more complex data structures.</li>\n",
        "<li>Broadcasting: This feature allows operations on arrays of different shapes without the need for explicit replication of data, making coding more efficient and intuitive.</li>\n",
        "<li>Universal Functions (ufuncs): NumPy provides a set of vectorized functions that operate on entire arrays, greatly enhancing performance for element-wise operations.</li>\n",
